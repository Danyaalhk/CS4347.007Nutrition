First, you will need to edit the DatabaseConnection.php file in NutritionDB_UI/UIPages and add the username and password for the SQL connection that contains the NutritionDB_Normalized database

Next, you will need to setup a web server on your computer like Apache that is configured to run PHP files

Next, add the NutritionDB_UI folder that contains the files for the front-end user interface into your web server file location

Finally, open a web browser and load your web server and NutritionDB.php in the NutritionDB_UI folder, entering http://localhost/NutritionDB_UI/UIPages/update.php should load the front-end user interface

The front-end user interface should be running on your browser and free to use
